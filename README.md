# Create Component VSCode Extension

## Feature

`Shift+Cmd+P` to trigger command prompt in VSCode, then `Create Component` will make you choose the folder where to create the component.
Right after, a new prompt will ask you to enter your component name.

Finally it will create a folder with basic files used with components:

- index.tsx
- component.tsx
- component.test.tsx
- component.stories.tsx
- component.scss

All these files are templated with a basic structure.
